### Variables

Variables are quite simply storage containers for values we would like to use now and in the future. If you were going to ask someone their name... you store that name, hopefully, so you can call it them again in the future.

```javascript
console.log("Your name is Jacob.");
console.log("Oh, who are you again?");

let name = "Jacob";
console.log(`Your name is ${name}`);
console.log(`Oh, hello again! Your name is ${name}. I remembered.`);
console.log(`Seriously, I remember you are called ${name}`);
```
